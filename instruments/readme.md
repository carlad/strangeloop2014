You will want some kind of IDE which is capable of sending code to a REPL instance.

There are many paths to getting this setup.
The most walked make our journey easier,
but there is nothing stopping you going off on your own.

### Sonic Pi

Sonic PI works with OSX + Windows + Raspberry Pi. It is a contained editor and audio environment. Which means you need to do nothing other than install the http://www.sonic-pi.net and you have your instrument and everything setup.

### Vim

Plugins for interacting with a REPL with Clojure:

* [vim-clojure-static](https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static)
* [vim-fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace)
* [vim-classpath](https://github.com/tpope/vim-classpath)


### Emacs

NOTE: if you want to use emacs-live ensure `emacs --version` >= 24.3

Ubuntu

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cassou/emacs
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install emacs24 emacs24-el emacs24-common-non-dfsg
````

Homebrew

```shell
brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb
$ brew linkapps Emacs
```

#### Emacs-live

Making an existing emacs ready for live coding very quickly:

```shell
bash <(curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/overtone/emacs-live/master/installer/install-emacs-live.sh)
```

### Vanilla Emacs

Ensure Cider && Clojure-mode packages are installed

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
  '("melpa-stable" . "http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/packages/") t)

(package-install 'cider)
(package-install 'clojure-mode))
```

### LightTable
